# Fabric Routing Protocols SubModule

The Fabric Route Filters Module will create a Route Filter Policy, add Route Filter Rules to it,
and attach the Route Filter Policy to an existing Fabric Connection.

Please refer to the cloud-router-2-port-connection-with-route-filters example in this module's
registry for more details on how to leverage the submodule.
