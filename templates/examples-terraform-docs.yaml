  ## Usage of Example Locally or in Your Own Configuration
  
  *Note:* This example creates resources which cost money. Run 'terraform destroy' when you don't need these resources.
  
  To provision this example directly,
  you should clone the github repository for this module and run terraform within this directory:

  terraform init
  terraform apply
  ```
  
  To use this example of the module in your own terraform configuration include the following:

  *NOTE: terraform.tfvars must be a separate file, but all other content can be placed together in main.tf if you prefer*

  terraform.tfvars (Replace these values with your own):
  ```hcl
  {{ include "terraform.tfvars.example" }}
  ```
  
  versions.tf
  ```hcl
  {{ include "versions.tf" }}
